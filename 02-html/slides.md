# Introduction
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the web.
- HTML is a markup language, which means it uses tags `< >` to tell the browser how to display the content of a web page. 
- The purpose of HTML is to describe the structure of a web page.
  - HTML defines headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links and more elements that make up a web page
- Standardized by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
- W3C handed HTML over to a group of browser vendors known as  Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).
  - WHATWG is made up of the four major browser vendors: Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla.
- The complete HTML specification is maintained by WHATWG at [https://html.spec.whatwg.org](https://html.spec.whatwg.org).

---

## History of HTML (I)
- HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.
- HTML version timeline:
  - 1991: The first public description of HTML is released. 
  - 1993: HTML 1.0 is released.
  - 1994: The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded and led by Tim Berners-Lee as the the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web.
  - 1995: HTML 2.0 is released.
  - 1997: HTML 3.0 is released.
  - 1998: W3C had shifted priorities away from HTML and instead began working on an XML-based equivalent, called XHTML. 
    - XHTML strictly enforce XML rules. If there was a syntax error, the page wouldnâ€™t load properly.
  - 1999: HTML 4.0 is released.

---

## History of HTML (II)
- HTML version timeline (Cont.):
    - 2000: XHTML 1.0 is released as a reformulation of HTML as an XML application.
    - 2004: WHATWG was founded by individuals of Apple, the Mozilla Foundation, and Opera Software.
    - 2008: HTML 5.0 first draft appeared with better support for video, audio, and mobile devices.
    - 2012: W3C and WHATWG announced that WHATWG would maintain a living standard, while the W3C would continue with versions.
    - 2014: HTML5 became a W3C recommendation.
    - 2019: both WHATWG and W3C signed an agreement to collaborate on a single version of HTML going forward: ["Living Standard"](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/).
- The W3C and WHATWG had different goals. WHATWG wanted to continue working on a Living Standard for HTML while W3C wanted to publish a finished implementation of HTML.
- WHATWG had set up a solid process in which HTML features get early support by browsers before the details of a specification are fully worked out.

---

## History of HTML (III)
- Interestingly, WHATWG existed due to the reason why W3C lost power over the HTML specs.
- In 2004, W3C abandoned organizational efforts on HTML in favor of the the Semantic Web, also known as Web 3.0.
  - Their efforts shifted to towards new standards that promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web such as XHMTL 2, RDF, OWL, etc.
- WHATWG was formed in reaction to that, rewriting HTML completely from its W3C HTML 4.0 version to make it better for web 2.0 applications.
- Now, that both groups came to an agreement, there will be no more versions of HTML. 
- Although HTML is a mature language, HTML specs are constantly being proposed, discussed, updated and revised in a draft called ["the living standard"](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/).
- W3C still controls a number of other important web technologies, including CSS, WebAssembly, and web performance.

## Concepts and Syntax

- The elements of HTML
- The `<!DOCTYPE`> element
- The `<head>` element
- The `<body>` element

## HTML Document

<iframe src="http://jsbin.com/dozulok/1/embed?html,output" title="HTML document Example" height="80%" width="100%"></iframe> 

- Save this as an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and open it up in your browser.

---

# The `!DOCTYPE` element
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

- In HTML the doctype is a required preamble at the top of HTML documents to prevent the browser from switching into the so-called "quirks mode" when rendering a document.
- In the old days of the web and before W3C HTML standards,  HTML documents were typically written in two versions for two major browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.
- Layout engines in web browsers support three modes: quirks mode, limited-quirks mode, and no-quirks mode.
  -  In **quirks mode**, layout engines emulate behavior in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5.
  - In **limited-quirks mode**, there are only a very small number of quirks implemented.
  - In **no-quirks mode**, layout engines emulate the behavior described by the modern HTML and CSS specifications.
    - The `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag is used to indicate that the HTML document uses the no-quirks mode.

---

# The `<head>` element
- The `<head>` element contains elements that won't get displayed in the web browser.
- It contains the `<meta>` element for metadata (data about the HTML document).
  - Examples include character encoding, description, and viewport size.
- It also contains other elements such as:
  - `<title>` for the document's title.
  - `<link>` for links to CSS, JS, and custom favicons.

```html {monaco}
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="author" content="Khalid Alharbi" />
    <meta name="description" content="This is CPIT 405 course website. 
          This course introduces students to web development using HTML, CSS, 
          Javascript, React, and PHP." />
    <link rel="icon"  type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon"  href="https://example.com/image.ico">
    <title>CPIT 405 - Learning HTML</title>
</head>
```

# The `<body>` element

::left::
- The `<body>` element represents the content of an HTML document. 
- There can be only one `<body>` element in a document.
- It has a number of attributes that can be used to control the appearance and behavior of the web page (e.g., `bgcolor` to set the document's background color). 
  - However, it is best to avoid using style attributes in HTML and to use CSS instead.
  - [Refer to the complete list of valid attributes on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body#attributes)

::right::


```html {monaco}
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Document title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      The body contains all of the content 
      that is displayed in the browser window.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

# HTML elements

- Text content elements: `<h1>` through `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>`.
- Inline elements: `<a>`, `<span>`, `<img>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, and `<table>`
- List elements: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<dl>`.
- Sectioning elements: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>`.
- Form elements: `<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>`.

---

# HTML Headings `<h1>` through `<h6>`

- Heading content defines the heading of a section 
- The `<h1>` to `<h6>` HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. 
  - `<h1>` is the highest section level and `<h6>` is the lowest.

<iframe src="http://jsbin.com/hamoray/5/embed?html,output" title="HTML document Example" height="50%" width="100%"></iframe> 

---

# Paragraphs `<p>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>`.
- The `<p>` element represents a paragraph.
- The `<strong>` element is used to add strong emphasis to text. It is typically displayed in bold.
  - Screen readers will pronounce the words in `<strong>` with added stress.
- The `<em>` element marks text that has stress emphasis. It is typically displayed in italic.
  - Screen readers will pronounce the words in `<em>` with an emphasis, using verbal stress.
- **NOTE**: These two tags should not be used to apply italic and bold styling. Instead, use the CSS `font-style` property for that purpose.

<iframe src="http://jsbin.com/fezufab/7/edit?html,output" title="HTML document Example" height="50%" width="100%"></iframe> 

---

# `<a>` The anchor element for links 
- The `<a>` element with its `href` attribute creates a hyperlink to a URL.
- Links are not restricted to web pages and can include email addresses, files, phone number, JavaScript, and anything else with a URL.
- The `target` attribute is used to indicate where to open the linked URL.
  -  Examples: `target="_blank"` will open the link in a new tab.

```html {monaco}
<a href="example.com" target="_blank">Go to example.com</a>

<a href="example.com">Go to example.com</a>

<a href="mailto:nowhere@example.com">Send email to nowhere</a>

<a href="tel:+9668008501520">Call FedEx Express now!</a>

<a sms="sms:1411">To check your balance, text 1 to 1411</a>

<a href="./file.pdf">Download PDF file</a>

<a href="javascript:alert('An alert message!');">Show me an alert popup in JavaScript</a>
```

# `<a>` The anchor element and internal links

::left::

- The anchor element, `<a>`, can be used to link to an element in the same webpage.
- This is often used to create links in a table of contents.
- Use the following steps to link to another element within the same HTML document:

  1. Add an `id` attribute to the HTML element that you want to link to (e.g., `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.).
  2. Add an anchor `<a>` element with an `href` attribute that points to the header element with the corresponding id attribute.

   ```html
   <a href="#section-1">
   <h1 id="section-1">Section 1</h1>
   ```

# HTML Sectioning elements
- HTML sectioning elements are used to define the structure of a web page. 
- They're use to organize the content on a page into logical sections, such as a header, footer, main content area, and navigation bar.
- The following are the HTML sectioning elements:
  - `<header>`: Represents the header of the page.
  - `<main>`: Represents the main content area of the page.
  - `<nav>`: Represents a section of navigation links.
  - `<footer>`: Represents the footer of the page.
  - `<article>`: Represents a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news article.
  - `<section>`: Represents a generic section of content.
  - `<aside>`: Represents a section of related content that is not essential to the main content of the page, such as a sidebar or footnote.

# The `<div>` and `<span>` elements
- The `<div>` and `<span>` elements are two of the most common HTML elements.
- The `<div>` element is a block-level element and often used to group related content together.
- The `<span>` element is an inline element and often used to format text.
- Both can be styled with CSS.
  - We'll learn about CSS next lecture!

# The `<code>`, `<pre>`, and `<samp>` elements
- These elements are used to preserve whitespace and make displaying code blocks more readable on the web.
- The `<code>` element is used for displaying text as code.
  - Typically used to display snippets of code.
- The `<pre>` element is used for displaying preformatted text.
  - Typically used to display text that needs to be preserved in its original format. 
- The `<samp>` element is used for displaying sample output.
- These three elements preserve the whitespace and line breaks of the original text inside them.
- The demo is next >>

# `<iframe>` element for embedding an HTML document
- The `<iframe>` element embeds another HTML document into the current document. 
- This can be used to embed content from any web page, a video, or an audio file.
- The `<iframe>` element has an attribute called `src` for specifying the URL of the content to be embedded.

# HTML inline vs block elements
HTML elements can be grouped into two categories: block level and inline elements.

::left::
## Inline elements:
- Do not start a new line
- Can't contain block elements
- - Avoid nesting block elements within inline elements.
- May be used to format text within a block element.
- Examples: `<a>`, `<img>`, `<span>`, `<input>`, `<button>`, `<label>`, and `<code>`.

```html{monaco}
<!-- INCORRECT: -->
<span><h1>Block h1 element</h1></span>

<!-- CORRECT: -->
<h1><span>Inline span element</span></h1>
```

::right::

## Block elements:
- Start a new line
- Can contain inline elements
- Cannot be nested within inline elements
- May be used to structure the content of the webpage.
- Examples: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<h1>`, `<form>`, `<table>`, and `<video>`.

```html{monaco}
<div> This is a block element.
<p> This is a paragraph, which is a block element.
<span> This is an inline element.
<a href="#"> This is a link, which is an inline element.
<img src="image.png" alt="This is an image, which is an inline element.">
</p>
</div>
```
---

# HTML void elements
- HTML elements that do not have a closing tag are called _void elements_.
- We do not need to close HTML void elements.
  - The closing tag is not required, but it is allowed.
- Void elements should be self-contained and not contain any other child elements.
- Void elements are typically used to represent content that is inserted into a document inline, such as an image `<img>`, or meta data such as the `<meta>` tag.
- Examples: `<area>`, `br`, `col`, `embed`, `hr`, `img`, `input`, `link`, and `meta`.

```html
<!-- INCORRECT: -->
<img src="image.png" alt="This is an image." ></img>

<!-- CORRECT: -->
<img src="image.png" alt="This is an image." />
<img src="image.png" alt="This is an image.">
```
